# Project Summary: Python 101 for Hackers

This project showcases the hands-on work I completed as part of the "Python 101 for Hackers" course by TCM Security. The goal of the project was to understand how Python can be used in practical cybersecurity workflows, focusing on automation, problem-solving and tool development. Throughout this journey, I explored how Python can simplify security tasks, break down complex problems and support offensive and defensive security activities.

The project includes multiple exercises where I translated security concepts into functional code. Rather than just learning Python syntax, I applied each concept through real-world examples and built scripts that demonstrate how automation can strengthen cybersecurity operations. This experience helped me deepen my understanding of both programming logic and security methodologies, all while developing tools that mirror real penetration testing workflows.

## Tech Stack Used

**Programming Language:**

* Python

**Libraries and Modules Explored:**

* `hashlib` for hashing operations
* `itertools` for brute-force logic
* `paramiko` for SSH automation
* `requests` for web requests and form submissions
* `sys`, `os`, and other standard libraries for input handling and system operations

**Tools and Environments:**

* Jupyter Notebook / Python scripts
* Linux environment for security testing
* Terminal-based execution and debugging

## Key Achievements

During this project, I built several practical cybersecurity tools that demonstrate the application of Python in hacking and automation contexts:

* A **SHA-256 cracker** that attempts to recover plaintext values by comparing hashes.
* An **SSH brute forcer** designed to automate the process of testing login credentials over SSH.
* A **web login brute forcer** capable of submitting repeated credential attempts to a target login page.

Each of these tools required understanding of security logic, control flow, error handling, networking concepts and Python automation patterns.
